# Kafka Notification

## Overview
**Kafka Notification** is a Java-based project focused on building a scalable and reliable notification system using Apache Kafka. The repository demonstrates best practices in event-driven architecture for delivering real-time notifications across distributed microservices.

## Key Features
- **Event Streaming:** Utilizes Kafka topics to publish and consume notification events in real time.
- **Microservices Architecture:** Modular service design for producers and consumers, enabling easy scaling and maintenance.
- **Integration with Java Frameworks:** Leverages Spring Boot for rapid development and dependency management.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Implements fault tolerance and resilience strategies for guaranteed message delivery.
- **Monitoring & Testing:** Includes logging, monitoring, and automated tests to ensure system reliability.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Apache Kafka
- Spring Boot
- Maven/Gradle (specify which one)
- REST API
- JUnit (for testing)

## Role & Contributions
